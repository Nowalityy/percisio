The software also relies on depth information and the target volume dimensions to authorize the intervention.",
      "para3": "PERCISIO only validates actions that remain within its certified precision range, ensuring procedural safety and maintaining the accuracy expected for image-guided interventions. By combining markerless body tracking, CT-based volumetric data, and augmented guidance overlays, PERCISIO enables precise percutaneous access to deep or complex lesions.",

The hologram displays the planned needle path, the entry point, and the distance to the lesion, enabling safe and intuitive guidance throughout the approach.",
      "para3": "If the target area is too small or too deep to guarantee full accuracy within PERCISIO's certified precision range, the system can be used to guide the initial trajectory and bring the needle as close as possible to the lesion. The practitioner can then complete the final step under CT control, combining PERCISIO's spatial guidance with conventional imaging for optimal precision.",

The fluid may be serous, hemorrhagic, purulent, or chylous, depending on the underlying cause — such as heart failure, infection, malignancy, or trauma.",
      "para2": "When the effusion becomes large, loculated, or symptomatic, a pleural drainage procedure is indicated to remove the fluid and allow the lung to re-expand. Under image guidance, a catheter is inserted through the chest wall into the pleural space, providing immediate decompression and clinical relief. The evacuated fluid can also be analyzed to determine its nature and guide further treatment.",
